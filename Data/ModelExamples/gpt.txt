Apple's new credit card will begin a preview roll out today and will become available to all iPhone owners in the US later this month. A random selection of people who applied for an Apple Card beta account last week will be sent invitations just before April 26, when everyone else can start using it too. The Apple Card is designed with privacy in mind: users aren't able to link their cards or view detailed transaction histories online as some other services do. The app itself also stores no personal data on your phone, only a virtual version in its secure payment system so you don't have to give Apple access to any sensitive details. It uses machine learning-based algorithms that learn from how you spend to provide personalized recommendations about your spending habits. Your transactions are stored offline on your device, the company says, while information like email addresses remains encrypted during transit between your devices and the cloud. And if you ever lose your physical card, Apple has said there's a way to temporarily disable the card without affecting payments until the actual one arrives.
